# Starbucks-Capstone-Project
This is a capstone project for the course completed in response to Udacity- Data Scientist Nanodegree Program.   
Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks.
Not all users receive the same offer, and that is the challenge to solve with this data set.   
Main task is to combine transaction, demographic and offer data to determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer type.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project was exploring the Starbuckâ€™s Dataset. I explored the data to discover the following:

* What are the total amount of offers?
* What product(s) have the highest rank?
* What types of offers to genders prefer? (What are the percentages of gender in the data?)
* What is the age range that completes the most offers?
* What is the income ranges of customers? (age and gender)

## Summary 
The project was completed in the following phases:

__Part 1: Main Focus__
Combine transaction, demographic and offer data to determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer type.
- Inspect 
- Clean 
- Analyze

__Part 2: Main Focus__
Build a machine learning model to predict the accuracy of offers completed from the EDA of part 1. 
- Model data 
- Test 3 different models 
- Tune one model to improve results 
- Conclusion on what should be done to better improve performance results

## Running the Application
In order to run the project, you can find the ipynb notebook file in the project directory which you can run directly, Make sure to keep the data set in the data folders, if the data location is changed, make sure to reflect the changes in the import section of the notebook file with necessary adjustments.   
In addition to this, you can also find the .html file in the project directory to take a quick glimpse of the project too.
